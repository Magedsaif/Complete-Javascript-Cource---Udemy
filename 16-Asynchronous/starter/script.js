// ASYNCHRONOUS JAVASCRIPT. AJAX AND APIS
// Asynchronous coordinats behavior of a program over a period of time.
// not happining in the same time
// we defer an action into the future making the code asynchronous

// AJAX: Asynchronous JavaScript And XML: allows us to communicate with remote web servers in an asynchronous way. Allows us to request data from web servers dynamically.

// API: Application Programming Interface: piece of software that can be used by another piece of software, in order to allow applications to talk to each other. In web development, an API is a piece of software that will allow two applications to talk to each other over the internet.

// API is not a database or a server. It is the code with access points to the server.

// some APIs are public, some are paid, some are private.

// "online" API: Application running on a server, that receives requests for data, and sends data back as response.


// we can build our own API (requires backend development skills) or use a third party API.
//  XMLHttpRequest (XHR) object: API in the form of an object, provided to us by the browser, to be used by client-side scripts like JavaScript. It is used to make HTTP requests to the server. It can send data to, and receive data from, a web server.
// we dont use XML anymore, we use JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) instead.
